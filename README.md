# Multi-Vendor Marketplace

## Overview

The Multi-Vendor Marketplace is a web application developed as a portfolio project in the 12-month ALX Software Engineering Programme. This project aims to provide a platform for multiple sellers to create and manage their own online stores, offering a diverse range of products to customers.

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branch
- **`main`**: This is the primary branch where the code always reflects a production-ready state.

### Development Branch
- **`dev`**: This branch is used for ongoing development. New features are merged into this branch before being integrated into the main branch.

### Feature Branches
- For new features or updates, create a branch from `dev`, e.g., `feature/new-feature`.
- Once the feature is complete and tested, it gets merged back into the `dev` branch.

### Workflow
- Regularly update your feature branch with changes from `dev` to minimize conflicts.
- After thorough testing in `dev`, merge changes into `main` for release.
- Use pull requests for merging, facilitating code reviews and discussions.
